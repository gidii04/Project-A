Working Process
Our working process at Kulijawa revolves around a systematic approach that ensures successful project delivery. Here's an overview of our process:

Planning: We begin by collaborating with our clients to understand their goals, requirements, and design preferences. This involves conducting thorough discussions and on-site visits to gain insights into the space and its potential.

Research: Once we have a clear understanding of the project scope, we conduct in-depth research on industry trends, materials, and techniques. This helps us develop a comprehensive design concept that combines creativity with practicality.

Estimating: With the design concept in place, we provide our clients with detailed cost estimates and timelines. Transparency and accurate estimations are paramount to us, ensuring that our clients have a clear understanding of the project's financial aspects.

Building: Once the design and estimates are approved, our team begins the execution phase. We work closely with skilled craftsmen and contractors to bring the design vision to reality. Regular site visits and project management ensure smooth progress and adherence to quality standards.
